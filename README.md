# TILとは

`Today I Learned`の略で、Github上にTILというリポジトリを作成してそこに今日覚えたことを書いていくというものです。

> Today I Learned
A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really warrant a full blog post. These are mostly things I learn by pairing with smart people at Hashrocket.
